Running a token-gated community on Telegram? 🛡️

Stop asking your members to connect their wallets to random websites. It's the #1 reason users churn or refuse to verify.

Enter @MemoOnSol: The first zero-trust, non-custodial gatekeeper. 👇

🚫 The Problem: Traditional bots (like Collab.Land) require users to "Connect Wallet" & sign a message. 
In a world of drainers, smart users are scared to click. Verification rates drop.

✅ The MEMO Solution: Zero connection required.
Users verify by sending a 0-value self-transfer on-chain. We just watch the blockchain.

Security is our north star. "Don't Trust. Verify."

Your members never expose their private keys or permissions.
Memo Protocol simply asks them to prove ownership by moving a dust amount of tokens to *themselves*.

It's 100% safe, treating every user like a sovereign individual.

For Admins: It's a Growth Tool 📈

By reducing one of the biggest friction points (fear of connecting wallets), you:
1. Increase member onboarding 🚀
2. Filter for actual holders (no bots) 🤖
3. Reduce sell pressure (holders stay to keep access) 💎

"Fail Closed" Architecture 🔒

Most bots fail "open" when APIs go down, letting randoms in. 
Memo fails closed. 

We use Telegram's "Request Admin Approval" mode to intercept every join request. 
If we can't verify them on-chain, they don't get in. Period.
